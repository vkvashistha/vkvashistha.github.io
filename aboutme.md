Heading multiple projects with an engineering team of 20 people from multiple domains (Frontend, backend, AI/ML, and DevOps)
Streamlining processes, fostering a productive and growing culture.
Have led and built 50+ AI projects in the last 3 years, including RAG-based educational chatbots, Agentic Applications like Invoice processing, HR Automation, Audit Compliance, Conversational Commerce. 

Projects
SmartTos - Marine Logistic ERP. Started with manual and automation testing to get deep understanding of this domain. Later worked on architecting and delivering Customer Portal module and LogiGPT module which is NL2SQL based project built on Open-Source WrenAI. Tools/Technology Used: Expo React, NestJS, Event Driven architecture, 
Storage System - Similar to Google Drive, Dropbox, etc. for a giant firm. Responsible for architecting and overseeing delivery of the project. Also code critical portions in mobile app related to background sync of files during resource crunch.
Live Media Console - Worked on One of the giant media and entertainment company. We architect and built the system to streamline cloud infrastructure creation automatically during schedule of Live Cricket Matches. Earlier this required a huge manual labour to setup cloud infrastructure for every match. Using AWS Cloudfront API, CDN APIs, we set up encoders, ladders, etc. I specifically worked upon building orchestrator to spin up relevant AWS services on right schedule. I also created a backend and frontend console to monitor events schedules and active events.
GetActyv - A computer vision based solution for physicians to prescribe exercises based on given health conditions. Then the system automatically instruct and monitor patients while they perform prescribed exercises. For this we used Google’s Vision api to get body landmarks and interpret joint angles to detect various postures. Tools/Tech Used: ReacJS, Flask, Google Mediapipe (Pose Landmark Detection), Azure/Google Speech Service 
Edtech AI Projects - With the team of 10 people, I drive over 25+ Generative AI projects for an EdTech emerging firm Convegenius.ai. This include subject/theme specific learning apps which includes both text + media (image/video) based question/answer based curiosity apps that served 300K student users on Swiftchat. Apart from this we also built Celebrity Bot for a famous politician for their election campaign. 
Customer Service Tickets Automation for a giant fintech firm: We finetuned Llama-8b to classify a large dataset of customer e-mails to classify and extract entities from text to generate structured data for creating Jira tickets and proposing automated actions for most common queries.
Micro Projects from Freelancer Portal - To generate initial revenue, I used Freelancer platform to get micro projects such as HR Automation Prototype (filtering resume, schedule calls, automatic voice calls). Automation testing projects, React Native to React migration, etc.
Rezo AI -  Another giant firm specialised in Customer Service technology provider. We finetuned GPT-2 for the recovery agent use-case. This helped in reducing the LLM token cost as compared to Prompt tuning.
